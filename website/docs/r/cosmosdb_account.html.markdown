# azurerm_cosmosdb_account

Manages a CosmosDB (formally DocumentDB) Account.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = var.resource_group_location
}

resource "random_integer" "ri" {
  min = 10000
  max = 99999
}

resource "azurerm_cosmosdb_account" "db" {
  name                = "tfex-cosmos-db-${random_integer.ri.result}"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  offer_type          = "Standard"
  kind                = "GlobalDocumentDB"

  enable_automatic_failover = true

  capabilities {
    name = "EnableAggregationPipeline"
  }

  capabilities {
    name = "mongoEnableDocLevelTTL"
  }

  capabilities {
    name = "MongoDBv3.4"
  }

  consistency_policy {
    consistency_level       = "BoundedStaleness"
    max_interval_in_seconds = 10
    max_staleness_prefix    = 200
  }

  geo_location {
    location          = var.failover_location
    failover_priority = 1
  }

  geo_location {
    location          = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
    failover_priority = 0
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the CosmosDB Account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the CosmosDB Account is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

* `offer_type` - (Required) Specifies the Offer Type to use for this CosmosDB Account - currently this can only be set to `Standard`.

* `kind` - (Optional) Specifies the Kind of CosmosDB to create - possible values are `GlobalDocumentDB` and `MongoDB`. Defaults to `GlobalDocumentDB`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `consistency_policy` - (Required) Specifies a `consistency_policy` resource, used to define the consistency policy for this CosmosDB account.

* `geo_location` - (Required) Specifies a `geo_location` resource, used to define where data should be replicated with the `failover_priority` 0 specifying the primary location. Value is a `geo_location` block as defined below.

* `ip_range_filter` - (Optional) CosmosDB Firewall Support: This value specifies the set of IP addresses or IP address ranges in CIDR form to be included as the allowed list of client IP's for a given database account. IP addresses/ranges must be comma separated and must not contain any spaces.

* `enable_free_tier` - (Optional) Enable Free Tier pricing option for this Cosmos DB account. Defaults to `false`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `analytical_storage_enabled` - (Optional) Enable Analytical Storage option for this Cosmos DB account. Defaults to `false`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `enable_automatic_failover` - (Optional) Enable automatic fail over for this Cosmos DB account.

* `public_network_access_enabled` - (Optional) Whether or not public network access is allowed for this CosmosDB account.

* `capabilities` - (Optional) The capabilities which should be enabled for this Cosmos DB account. Value is a `capabilities` block as defined below.

* `is_virtual_network_filter_enabled` - (Optional) Enables virtual network filtering for this Cosmos DB account.

* `key_vault_key_id` - (Optional) A versionless Key Vault Key ID for CMK encryption. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **NOTE:** When referencing an `azurerm_key_vault_key` resource, use `versionless_id` instead of `id`

~> **NOTE:** In order to use a `Custom Key` from Key Vault for encryption you must grant Azure Cosmos DB Service access to your key vault. For instuctions on how to configure your Key Vault correctly please refer to the [product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-cmk#add-an-access-policy-to-your-azure-key-vault-instance)

* `virtual_network_rule` - (Optional) Specifies a `virtual_network_rules` resource, used to define which subnets are allowed to access this CosmosDB account.

* `enable_multiple_write_locations` - (Optional) Enable multi-master support for this Cosmos DB account.

`consistency_policy` Configures the database consistency and supports the following:

* `consistency_level` - (Required) The Consistency Level to use for this CosmosDB Account - can be either `BoundedStaleness`, `Eventual`, `Session`, `Strong` or `ConsistentPrefix`.
* `max_interval_in_seconds` - (Optional) When used with the Bounded Staleness consistency level, this value represents the time amount of staleness (in seconds) tolerated. Accepted range for this value is `5` - `86400` (1 day). Defaults to `5`. Required when `consistency_level` is set to `BoundedStaleness`.
* `max_staleness_prefix` - (Optional) When used with the Bounded Staleness consistency level, this value represents the number of stale requests tolerated. Accepted range for this value is `10` â€“ `2147483647`. Defaults to `100`. Required when `consistency_level` is set to `BoundedStaleness`.

~> **Note**: `max_interval_in_seconds` and `max_staleness_prefix` can only be set to custom values when `consistency_level` is set to `BoundedStaleness` - otherwise they will return the default values shown above.

`geo_location` Configures the geographic locations the data is replicated to and supports the following:

* `prefix` - (Optional) The string used to generate the document endpoints for this region. If not specified it defaults to `${cosmosdb_account.name}-${location}`. Changing this causes the location to be deleted and re-provisioned and cannot be changed for the location with failover priority `0`.
* `location` - (Required) The name of the Azure region to host replicated data.
* `failover_priority` - (Required) The failover priority of the region. A failover priority of `0` indicates a write region. The maximum value for a failover priority = (total number of regions - 1). Failover priority values must be unique for each of the regions in which the database account exists. Changing this causes the location to be re-provisioned and cannot be changed for the location with failover priority `0`.
* `zone_redundant` - (Optional) Should zone redundancy be enabled for this region? Defaults to `false`.

`capabilities` Configures the capabilities to enable for this Cosmos DB account:

* `name` - (Required) The capability to enable - Possible values are `AllowSelfServeUpgradeToMongo36`, `DisableRateLimitingResponses`, `EnableAggregationPipeline`, `EnableCassandra`, `EnableGremlin`, `EnableMongo`, `EnableTable`, `EnableServerless`, `MongoDBv3.4` and `mongoEnableDocLevelTTL`.

**NOTE:** The `prefix` and `failover_priority` fields of a location cannot be changed for the location with a failover priority of `0`.

`virtual_network_rule` Configures the virtual network subnets allowed to access this Cosmos DB account and supports the following:

* `id` - (Required) The ID of the virtual network subnet.
* `ignore_missing_vnet_service_endpoint` - (Optional) If set to true, the specified subnet will be added as a virtual network rule even if its CosmosDB service endpoint is not active. Defaults to `false`.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The CosmosDB Account ID.

* `endpoint` - The endpoint used to connect to the CosmosDB account.

* `read_endpoints` - A list of read endpoints available for this CosmosDB account.

* `write_endpoints` - A list of write endpoints available for this CosmosDB account.

* `primary_key` - The Primary master key for the CosmosDB Account.

* `secondary_key` - The Secondary master key for the CosmosDB Account.

* `primary_readonly_key` - The Primary read-only master Key for the CosmosDB Account.

* `secondary_readonly_key` - The Secondary read-only master key for the CosmosDB Account.

* `connection_strings` - A list of connection strings available for this CosmosDB account.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 180 minutes) Used when creating the CosmosDB Account.
* `update` - (Defaults to 180 minutes) Used when updating the CosmosDB Account.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the CosmosDB Account.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 180 minutes) Used when deleting the CosmosDB Account.
