# azurerm_container_group

Manages as an Azure Container Group instance.

## Example Usage

This example provisions a Basic Container. Other examples of the `azurerm_container_group` resource can be found in [the `./examples/container-instance` directory within the Github Repository](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/master/examples/container-instance).

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_container_group" "example" {
  name                = "example-continst"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  ip_address_type     = "public"
  dns_name_label      = "aci-label"
  os_type             = "Linux"

  container {
    name   = "hello-world"
    image  = "microsoft/aci-helloworld:latest"
    cpu    = "0.5"
    memory = "1.5"

    ports {
      port     = 443
      protocol = "TCP"
    }
  }

  container {
    name   = "sidecar"
    image  = "microsoft/aci-tutorial-sidecar"
    cpu    = "0.5"
