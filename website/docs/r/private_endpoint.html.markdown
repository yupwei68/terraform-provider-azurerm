# azurerm_private_endpoint

Manages a Private Endpoint.

Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. The service could be an Azure service such as Azure Storage, SQL, etc. or your own Private Link Service.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-network"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "service" {
  name                 = "service"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]

  enforce_private_link_service_network_policies = true
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "endpoint" {
  name                 = "endpoint"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.2.0/24"]

  enforce_private_link_endpoint_network_policies = true
}

  nat_ip_configuration {
    name      = azurerm_public_ip.example.name
    primary   = true
    subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.service.id
  }

  load_balancer_frontend_ip_configuration_ids = [
    azurerm_lb.example.frontend_ip_configuration.0.id,
  ]
}

resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "example" {
  name                = "example-endpoint"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  subnet_id           = azurerm_subnet.endpoint.id

  private_service_connection {
    name                           = "example-privateserviceconnection"
    private_connection_resource_id = azurerm_private_link_service.example.id
    is_manual_connection           = false
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Private Endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Resource Group within which the Private Endpoint should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `subnet_id` - (Required) The ID of the Subnet from which Private IP Addresses will be allocated for this Private Endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `private_dns_zone_group` - (Optional) A `private_dns_zone_group` block as defined below.

* `private_service_connection` - (Required) A `private_service_connection` block as defined below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

A `private_dns_zone_group` supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Private DNS Zone Group. Changing this forces a new `private_dns_zone_group` resource to be created.

* `private_dns_zone_ids` - (Required) Specifies the list of Private DNS Zones to include within the `private_dns_zone_group`.

---

A `private_service_connection` supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Private Service Connection. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `is_manual_connection` - (Required) Does the Private Endpoint require Manual Approval from the remote resource owner? Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** If you are trying to connect the Private Endpoint to a remote resource without having the correct RBAC permissions on the remote resource set this value to `true`.

* `private_connection_resource_id` - (Required) The ID of the Private Link Enabled Remote Resource which this Private Endpoint should be connected to. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `subresource_names` - (Optional) A list of subresource names which the Private Endpoint is able to connect to. `subresource_names` corresponds to `group_id`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> Several possible values for this field are shown below, however this is not extensive:

| Resource Type                 | SubResource Name | Secondary SubResource Name |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Data Lake File System Gen2    | dfs              | dfs_secondary              |
| Sql Database / Data Warehouse | sqlServer        |                            |
| Storage Account               | blob             | blob_secondary             |
| Storage Account               | file             | file_secondary             |
| Storage Account               | queue            | queue_secondary            |
| Storage Account               | table            | table_secondary            |
| Storage Account               | web              | web_secondary              |

See the product [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#dns-configuration) for more information.

* `request_message` - (Optional) A message passed to the owner of the remote resource when the private endpoint attempts to establish the connection to the remote resource. The request message can be a maximum of `140` characters in length. Only valid if `is_manual_connection` is set to `true`.
