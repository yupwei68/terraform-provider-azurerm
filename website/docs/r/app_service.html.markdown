# azurerm_app_service

Manages an App Service (within an App Service Plan).

-> **Note:** When using Slots - the `app_settings`, `connection_string` and `site_config` blocks on the `azurerm_app_service` resource will be overwritten when promoting a Slot using the `azurerm_app_service_active_slot` resource.

## Example Usage

This example provisions a Windows App Service. Other examples of the `azurerm_app_service` resource can be found in [the `./examples/app-service` directory within the Github Repository](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/master/examples/app-service)

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_app_service_plan" "example" {
  name                = "example-appserviceplan"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  sku {
    tier = "Standard"
    size = "S1"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_app_service" "example" {
  name                = "example-app-service"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  app_service_plan_id = azurerm_app_service_plan.example.id

  site_config {
    dotnet_framework_version = "v4.0"
    scm_type                 = "LocalGit"
  }

  app_settings = {
    "SOME_KEY" = "some-value"
  }

  connection_string {
    name  = "Database"
    type  = "SQLServer"
