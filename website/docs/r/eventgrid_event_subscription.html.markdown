Manages an EventGrid Event Subscription

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "default" {
  name     = "defaultResourceGroup"
  location = "West US 2"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "default" {
  name                     = "defaultStorageAccount"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.default.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.default.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"

  tags = {
    environment = "staging"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_storage_queue" "default" {
  name                 = "defaultStorageQueue"
  storage_account_name = azurerm_storage_account.default.name
}

resource "azurerm_eventgrid_event_subscription" "default" {
  name  = "defaultEventSubscription"
  scope = azurerm_resource_group.default.id

  storage_queue_endpoint {
    storage_account_id = azurerm_storage_account.default.id
    queue_name         = azurerm_storage_queue.default.name
  }
}
```
