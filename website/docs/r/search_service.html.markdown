# azurerm_search_service

Allows you to manage an Azure Search Service.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "acceptanceTestResourceGroup1"
  location = "West US"
}

resource "azurerm_search_service" "example" {
  name                = "acceptanceTestSearchService1"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  sku                 = "standard"

  tags = {
    environment = "staging"
    database    = "test"
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Search Service. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Search Service. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `sku` - (Required) Valid values are `basic`, `free` and `standard`. `standard2` and `standard3` are also valid, but can only be used when it's enabled on the backend by Microsoft support. `free` provisions the service in shared clusters. `standard` provisions the service in dedicated clusters.  Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `replica_count` - (Optional) Default is 1. Valid values include 1 through 12. Valid only when `sku` is `standard`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `partition_count` - (Optional) Default is 1. Valid values include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12. Valid only when `sku` is `standard`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
