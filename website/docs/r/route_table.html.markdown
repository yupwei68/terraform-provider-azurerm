## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "acceptanceTestResourceGroup1"
  location = "West US"
}

resource "azurerm_route_table" "example" {
  name                          = "acceptanceTestSecurityGroup1"
  location                      = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name           = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  disable_bgp_route_propagation = false

  route {
    name           = "route1"
    address_prefix = "10.1.0.0/16"
    next_hop_type  = "vnetlocal"
  }

  tags = {
    environment = "Production"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the route table. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the route table. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `route` - (Optional) [List of objects](/docs/configuration/attr-as-blocks.html) representing routes. Each object accepts the arguments documented below.

* `disable_bgp_route_propagation` - (Optional) Boolean flag which controls propagation of routes learned by BGP on that route table. True means disable.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

Elements of `route` support:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the route.

* `address_prefix` - (Required) The destination CIDR to which the route applies, such as 10.1.0.0/16

* `next_hop_type` - (Required) The type of Azure hop the packet should be sent to. Possible values are `VirtualNetworkGateway`, `VnetLocal`, `Internet`, `VirtualAppliance` and `None`.

* `next_hop_in_ip_address` - (Optional) Contains the IP address packets should be forwarded to. Next hop values are only allowed in routes where the next hop type is `VirtualAppliance`.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Route Table ID.
* `subnets` - The collection of Subnets associated with this route table.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Route Table.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Route Table.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Route Table.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Route Table.

## Import

Route Tables can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_route_table.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/routeTables/mytable1
```
