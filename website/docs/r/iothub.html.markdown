# azurerm_iothub

Manages an IotHub

~> **NOTE:** Endpoints can be defined either directly on the `azurerm_iothub` resource, or using the `azurerm_iothub_endpoint_*` resources - but the two ways of defining the endpoints cannot be used together. If both are used against the same IoTHub, spurious changes will occur. Also, defining a `azurerm_iothub_endpoint_*` resource and another endpoint of a different type directly on the `azurerm_iothub` resource is not supported.

~> **NOTE:** Routes can be defined either directly on the `azurerm_iothub` resource, or using the `azurerm_iothub_route` resource - but the two cannot be used together. If both are used against the same IoTHub, spurious changes will occur.

~> **NOTE:** Fallback route can be defined either directly on the `azurerm_iothub` resource, or using the `azurerm_iothub_fallback_route` resource - but the two cannot be used together. If both are used against the same IoTHub, spurious changes will occur.

## Import

IoTHubs can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_iothub.hub1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs/hub1
```
