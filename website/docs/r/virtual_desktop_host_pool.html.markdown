resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_desktop_host_pool" "example" {
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  name                     = "pooleddepthfirst"
  friendly_name            = "pooleddepthfirst"
  validate_environment     = true
  description              = "Acceptance Test: A pooled host pool - pooleddepthfirst"
  type                     = "Pooled"
  maximum_sessions_allowed = 50
  load_balancer_type       = "DepthFirst"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Virtual Desktop Host Pool. Changing the name
    forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to
    create the Virtual Desktop Host Pool. Changing the resource group name forces
    a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The location/region where the Virtual Desktop Host Pool is
    located. Changing the location/region forces a new resource to be created.

* `type` - (Required) The type of the Virtual Desktop Host Pool. Valid options are
    `Personal` or `Pooled`. Changing the type forces a new resource to be created.

* `load_balancer_type` -  (Optional) `BreadthFirst` load balancing distributes new user sessions across all available session hosts in the host pool.
    `DepthFirst` load balancing distributes new user sessions to an available session host with the highest number of connections but has not reached its maximum session limit threshold.
