# azurerm_kubernetes_cluster

Manages a Managed Kubernetes Cluster (also known as AKS / Azure Kubernetes Service)

~> **Note:** All arguments including the client secret will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage

This example provisions a basic Managed Kubernetes Cluster. Other examples of the `azurerm_kubernetes_cluster` resource can be found in [the `./examples/kubernetes` directory within the Github Repository](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/master/examples/kubernetes)

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  name                = "example-aks1"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  dns_prefix          = "exampleaks1"

  default_node_pool {
    name       = "default"
    node_count = 1
    vm_size    = "Standard_D2_v2"
  }

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

output "client_certificate" {
  value = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.example.kube_config.0.client_certificate
}

output "kube_config" {
  value = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.example.kube_config_raw
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Managed Kubernetes Cluster to create. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The location where the Managed Kubernetes Cluster should be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Specifies the Resource Group where the Managed Kubernetes Cluster should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `default_node_pool` - (Required) A `default_node_pool` block as defined below.

* `dns_prefix` - (Required) DNS prefix specified when creating the managed cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** The `dns_prefix` must contain between 3 and 45 characters, and can contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens. It must start with a letter and must end with a letter or a number.

In addition, one of either `identity` or `service_principal` blocks must be specified.

* `api_server_authorized_ip_ranges` - (Optional) The IP ranges to whitelist for incoming traffic to the masters.

* `auto_scaler_profile` - (Optional) A `auto_scaler_profile` block as defined below.

* `disk_encryption_set_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Disk Encryption Set which should be used for the Nodes and Volumes. More information [can be found in the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-disk-customer-managed-keys).

* `identity` - (Optional) A `identity` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** One of either `identity` or `service_principal` must be specified.

* `kubernetes_version` - (Optional) Version of Kubernetes specified when creating the AKS managed cluster. If not specified, the latest recommended version will be used at provisioning time (but won't auto-upgrade).

-> **NOTE:** Upgrading your cluster may take up to 10 minutes per node.

* `linux_profile` - (Optional) A `linux_profile` block as defined below.

* `network_profile` - (Optional) A `network_profile` block as defined below.

-> **NOTE:** If `network_profile` is not defined, `kubenet` profile will be used by default.

* `node_resource_group` - (Optional) The name of the Resource Group where the Kubernetes Nodes should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** Azure requires that a new, non-existent Resource Group is used, as otherwise the provisioning of the Kubernetes Service will fail.

* `private_cluster_enabled` Should this Kubernetes Cluster have its API server only exposed on internal IP addresses? This provides a Private IP Address for the Kubernetes API on the Virtual Network where the Kubernetes Cluster is located. Defaults to `false`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

```
resource "azurerm_subnet" "virtual" {

  #...

  delegation {
    name = "aciDelegation"
    service_delegation {
