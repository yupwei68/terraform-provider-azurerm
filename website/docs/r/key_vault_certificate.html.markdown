# azurerm_key_vault_certificate

Manages a Key Vault Certificate.

## Example Usage (Importing a PFX)

~> **Note:** this example assumed the PFX file is located in the same directory at `certificate-to-import.pfx`.

```hcl
data "azurerm_client_config" "current" {
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "key-vault-certificate-example"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_key_vault" "example" {
  name                = "keyvaultcertexample"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  tenant_id           = data.azurerm_client_config.current.tenant_id

  sku_name = "standard"

  access_policy {
    tenant_id = data.azurerm_client_config.current.tenant_id
    object_id = data.azurerm_client_config.current.object_id

    certificate_permissions = [
      "create",
      "delete",
      "deleteissuers",
      "get",
      "getissuers",
      "import",

      reuse_key  = false
    }

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Key Vault Certificate. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `key_vault_id` - (Required) The ID of the Key Vault where the Certificate should be created.

* `certificate` - (Optional) A `certificate` block as defined below, used to Import an existing certificate.

* `certificate_policy` - (Required) A `certificate_policy` block as defined below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

`certificate` supports the following:

* `contents` - (Required) The base64-encoded certificate contents. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `password` - (Optional) The password associated with the certificate. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

`certificate_policy` supports the following:

* `issuer_parameters` - (Required) A `issuer_parameters` block as defined below.
* `key_properties` - (Required) A `key_properties` block as defined below.
* `lifetime_action` - (Optional) A `lifetime_action` block as defined below.
* `secret_properties` - (Required) A `secret_properties` block as defined below.
* `x509_certificate_properties` - (Optional) A `x509_certificate_properties` block as defined below. Required when `certificate` block is not specified.

`issuer_parameters` supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Certificate Issuer. Possible values include `Self` (for self-signed certificate), or `Unknown` (for a certificate issuing authority like `Let's Encrypt` and Azure direct supported ones). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

`key_properties` supports the following:

* `exportable` - (Required) Is this Certificate Exportable? Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `key_size` - (Required) The size of the Key used in the Certificate. Possible values include `2048` and `4096`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `key_type` - (Required) Specifies the Type of Key, such as `RSA`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `reuse_key` - (Required) Is the key reusable? Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

`lifetime_action` supports the following:

`trigger` supports the following:

* `days_before_expiry` - (Optional) The number of days before the Certificate expires that the action associated with this Trigger should run. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Conflicts with `lifetime_percentage`.
* `lifetime_percentage` - (Optional) The percentage at which during the Certificates Lifetime the action associated with this Trigger should run. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Conflicts with `days_before_expiry`.

`secret_properties` supports the following:

* `content_type` - (Required) The Content-Type of the Certificate, such as `application/x-pkcs12` for a PFX or `application/x-pem-file` for a PEM. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

`x509_certificate_properties` supports the following:

* `extended_key_usage` - (Optional) A list of Extended/Enhanced Key Usages. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `key_usage` - (Required) A list of uses associated with this Key. Possible values include `cRLSign`, `dataEncipherment`, `decipherOnly`, `digitalSignature`, `encipherOnly`, `keyAgreement`, `keyCertSign`, `keyEncipherment` and `nonRepudiation` and are case-sensitive. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `subject` - (Required) The Certificate's Subject. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `subject_alternative_names` - (Optional) A `subject_alternative_names` block as defined below.
* `validity_in_months` - (Required) The Certificates Validity Period in Months. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `thumbprint` - The X509 Thumbprint of the Key Vault Certificate represented as a hexadecimal string.
* `certificate_attribute` - A `certificate_attribute` block as defined below.

---

A `certificate_attribute` block exports the following:

* `created` - The create time of the Key Vault Certificate.
* `enabled` - whether the Key Vault Certificate is enabled.

## Timeouts



The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Key Vault Certificate.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Key Vault Certificate.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Key Vault Certificate.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Key Vault Certificate.

## Import

Key Vault Certificates can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_key_vault_certificate.examplehttps://example-keyvault.vault.azure.net/certificates/example/fdf067c93bbb4b22bff4d8b7a9a56217
```
