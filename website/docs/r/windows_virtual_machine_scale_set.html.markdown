# azurerm_windows_virtual_machine_scale_set

Manages a Windows Virtual Machine Scale Set.

## Disclaimers

~> **Note**: All arguments including the administrator login and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

-> **Note** Terraform will automatically update & reimage the nodes in the Scale Set (if Required) during an Update - this behaviour can be configured [using the `features` setting within the Provider block](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html#features).

~> **Note:** This resource does not support Unmanaged Disks. If you need to use Unmanaged Disks you can continue to use [the `azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set` resource](virtual_machine_scale_set.html) instead
