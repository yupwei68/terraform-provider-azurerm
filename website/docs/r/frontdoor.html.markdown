# azurerm_frontdoor

Manages an Azure Front Door instance.

Azure Front Door Service is Microsoft's highly available and scalable web application acceleration platform and global HTTP(s) load balancer. It provides built-in DDoS protection and application layer security and caching. Front Door enables you to build applications that maximize and automate high-availability and performance for your end-users. Use Front Door with Azure services including Web/Mobile Apps, Cloud Services and Virtual Machines â€“ or combine it with on-premises services for hybrid deployments and smooth cloud migration.

Below are some of the key scenarios that Azure Front Door Service addresses:
* Use Front Door to improve application scale and availability with instant multi-region failover
* Use Front Door to improve application performance with SSL offload and routing requests to the fastest available application backend.
* Use Front Door for application layer security and DDoS protection for your application.

## Example Usage

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "FrontDoorExampleResourceGroup"
  location = "EastUS2"
