# Data Source: azurerm_kubernetes_cluster

Use this data source to access information about an existing Managed Kubernetes Cluster (AKS).

~> **Note:** All arguments including the client secret will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  name                = "myakscluster"
  resource_group_name = "my-example-resource-group"
}
