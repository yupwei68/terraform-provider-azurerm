# Data Source: azurerm_virtual_network_gateway

Use this data source to access information about an existing Virtual Network Gateway.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_virtual_network_gateway" "example" {
  name                = "production"
  resource_group_name = "networking"
}

output "virtual_network_gateway_id" {
  value = data.azurerm_virtual_network_gateway.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - Specifies the name of the Virtual Network Gateway.
* `resource_group_name` - Specifies the name of the resource group the Virtual Network Gateway is located in.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The ID of the Virtual Network Gateway.

* `location` - The location/region where the Virtual Network Gateway is located.

* `type` - The type of the Virtual Network Gateway.

* `vpn_type` - The routing type of the Virtual Network Gateway.

* `enable_bgp` - Will BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) will be enabled
    for this Virtual Network Gateway.

* `active_active` - Is this an Active-Active Gateway?

* `default_local_network_gateway_id` -  The ID of the local network gateway
    through which outbound Internet traffic from the virtual network in which the
    gateway is created will be routed (*forced tunneling*). Refer to the
    [Azure documentation on forced tunneling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-forced-tunneling-rm).

* `sku` - Configuration of the size and capacity of the Virtual Network Gateway.

* `generation` - The Generation of the Virtual Network Gateway.

* `ip_configuration` - One or two `ip_configuration` blocks documented below.

* `vpn_client_configuration` - A `vpn_client_configuration` block which is documented below.

* `tags` - A mapping of tags assigned to the resource.

The `ip_configuration` block supports:

* `name` - A user-defined name of the IP configuration.

* `private_ip_address_allocation` - Defines how the private IP address
    of the gateways virtual interface is assigned.

* `subnet_id` - The ID of the gateway subnet of a virtual network in
    which the virtual network gateway will be created. It is mandatory that
    the associated subnet is named `GatewaySubnet`. Therefore, each virtual
    network can contain at most a single Virtual Network Gateway.

* `public_ip_address_id` - The ID of the Public IP Address associated
    with the Virtual Network Gateway.

The `vpn_client_configuration` block supports:

* `address_space` - The address space out of which ip addresses for
    vpn clients will be taken. You can provide more than one address space, e.g.
    in CIDR notation.

* `root_certificate` - One or more `root_certificate` blocks which are
    defined below. These root certificates are used to sign the client certificate
    used by the VPN clients to connect to the gateway.

* `revoked_certificate` - One or more `revoked_certificate` blocks which
    are defined below.

* `radius_server_address` - The address of the Radius server.
    This setting is incompatible with the use of `root_certificate` and `revoked_certificate`.

* `radius_server_secret` - The secret used by the Radius server.
    This setting is incompatible with the use of `root_certificate` and `revoked_certificate`.

* `vpn_client_protocols` - List of the protocols supported by the vpn client.
    The supported values are `SSTP`, `IkeV2` and `OpenVPN`.

The `bgp_settings` block supports:

* `asn` - The Autonomous System Number (ASN) to use as part of the BGP.

* `peering_address` - The BGP peer IP address of the virtual network
    gateway. This address is needed to configure the created gateway as a BGP Peer
    on the on-premises VPN devices.

* `peer_weight` - The weight added to routes which have been learned
    through BGP peering.

The `root_certificate` block supports:

* `name` - The user-defined name of the root certificate.

* `public_cert_data` - The public certificate of the root certificate
    authority. The certificate must be provided in Base-64 encoded X.509 format
    (PEM).

The `root_revoked_certificate` block supports:

* `name` - The user-defined name of the revoked certificate.

* `public_cert_data` - The SHA1 thumbprint of the certificate to be revoked.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Virtual Network Gateway.
